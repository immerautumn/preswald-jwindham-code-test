# Hello there

(Now that the test is over and it's recorded, I figured I would ship you a quick readme update!)

Thanks for taking a look at my resume. I've never worked with preswald before, and I found it wouldn't ingest my datafile when used with the TOML configuration, nor via data/mmp_sample_data.csv

So I went around it with pandas xD. I hope that's okay. If not, I'll understand; I'm sure it works under the right circumstances, but I made note of that and linked the docs I consumed. I can see 
that this platform is a bit fiddly depending on version. I hope you don't mind, but I familiarized myself with it a touch.

Thanks for your time. Speaking of time, since I was time limited, you'll notice that the code isn't really hinted, which I prefer, 
but I figured you were really just looking to see if I could do some basic manipulation, that this would be enough.

I hope you have a great day!


BTW; I couldn't move the files using the preswald code / script editor that you had, so I tried to load them from data, but gonna go ahead and wager that this was the problem for rendering the favicon and branding. So I'll move those in this version.
